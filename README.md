# Face Recognition Using Google Teachable Machine
- This project explores Google Teachable Machine for creating a real-time face recognition system using OpenCV.<br><br>
- Project Overview: <br><br>
●	A face recognition model was trained using images of four individuals in Google Teachable Machine.<br>
●	The trained model was then downloaded for further use.<br>
●	A real-time face recognition window was implemented using OpenCV, which can accurately identify these four faces in real time. <br><br>
Project Files:<br><br>
1.	Python script (.py file) – Executes the real-time face recognition system.<br>
2.	Model file (.h5 file) – The trained model for face recognition.<br>
3.	Label file (.txt file) – Contains labels corresponding to the trained faces.<br><br>
How to Run:<br><br>
Simply execute the Python script (.py file) to start the real-time face recognition system.<br>
